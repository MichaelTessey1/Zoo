        The lion is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. 
        It has a muscular, broad-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a 
        hairy tuft at the end of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions 
        are larger than females and have a prominent mane.
