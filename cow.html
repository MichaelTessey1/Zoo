        Cattle are large domesticated bovines. They are most widespread species of the genus Bos. 
        Adult females are referred to as cows and adult males are referred to as bulls. 
        Cattle are commonly raised as livestock for meat, for milk, and for hides, 
        which are used to make leather.
